GENESIS OF DATA IN /data2/dockets/sqlite/pydockets.db 

1. Tables in db were created using /data2/dockets/sqlite/code/make-sqlite-tables.py

2. Workhorse file is /data2/dockets/sqlite/code/read-into-sqlite-tables.py, which does this:

    a. Parses each XML file in /data2/dockets/*xml 
    b. Processes to extract key info for each docket
    c. Inserts into /data2/dockets/sqlite/pydockets.db 
    
    NB: I used /data2/dockets/utilities/docketsFileReader_new.py to do
    	this, b/c that file allows processing without writing csv.

3. Additional column added to wlfilename table and then populated by
   /data2/dockets/sqlite/code/make-additional-wlfilename-columns.py.
